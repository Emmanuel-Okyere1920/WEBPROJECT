            <li>You don’t have to be an expert</li>
            <p> You don't need a graphic design degree to start designing. If you're working on personal projects or small business designs, learning by doing and experimenting is a great way to begin. Many successful designers were once amateurs who improved through practice. Stay curious, embrace the learning process, and use online resources to help you grow your skills.               <br>When I started designing stationery I literally had zero experience. I just learned as I went, playing around with different techniques, figuring things out along the way and faking it the whole time. You don’t have to be an expert.</p>
            <li>Start with the right program</li>
            <p>My graphic design journey began with Microsoft Publisher, then moved to a free design program, but I faced limitations with both. I was initially intimidated by Adobe Illustrator, but gradually learned its features and found it to be far superior. Illustrator offers powerful tools, like adding special characters, adjusting letter spacing, creating clipping masks, and picking colors. Starting with the right program from the beginning can save a lot of frustration and help you achieve better results.</p>
            <li>There’s no need for a fancy computer</li>
            <p>You’ve probably heard it said that a Mac is best for creating graphics. This is true and I’m a big fan of all things Apple, but I didn’t start out with anything special.
                <br>In fact, the laptop I used when I first began designing sounded like the motor was about to take off after about an hour of use and it got so hot I had to keep it off my lap while working. Definitely nothing fancy.
                <br>There’s no need to go out an invest in a new computer, just make sure the one you have has enough memory to run Illustrator.</p>
                <br>Moral of the story is: don’t go out and buy the extras until you know you need them. Most of the time I design using my wireless mouse on my main computer, occasionally with the trackpad on my laptop and when I really need details, I’ll draw on paper first and scan it into Illustrator to turn into a vector graphic.</p>
            <li>You will get (so much) better with time</li>
            <p>As with most learned skills, practice makes a huge difference. As you learn new techniques and helpful short cuts you’ll get faster and more proficient and over time, you’ll really hone in on your style. It’s fun to see how your designs progress with time. You may cringe a little at your first work (I sure do!) but that’s all part of the learning curve.</p>
