            <ol>
                <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
                <p>Adobe Photoshop has long remained the industry standard for desktop publishing. It is a popular favorite with graphic designers for a reason. Its array of image editing tools supports the beginner to the pro with a user-friendly interface and a plethora of well-written tutorials. The graphic design software puts you in control, from the canvas size to the artistic filter.</p>
<li>CorelDraw</li>
                <p>CorelDraw is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by Corel Corporation. It is also the name of the Corel graphics suite, which includes the bitmap-image editor Corel Photo-Paint as well as other graphics-related programs.</p>
                <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
                <p>Adobe Illustrator wrote the book on vector graphics software. It sets the standard for professionally designed logos, artwork, infographics, icons, and much more. You can work from a freehand sketch to a vector image that is scalable to any size. Adobe Illustrator works with graphics differently, using mathematical formulas instead of pixels for seamless resizing.</p>
                 <li>Gravit Designer</li>
                <p>Gravit Designer is more than just an image editing software — it’s also a GNU image manipulation program and vector illustration software. The best part of Gravit Designer is how customizable and user-friendly it is, as its HTML-based program is compatible with most platforms. Gravit Designer includes 500 MB of cloud storage with the free plan and unlimited storage with the pro version</p>
                                <li>Figma</li>
                <p>Figma offers a lot of features for free graphic design software. One of the most impressive is the free unlimited cloud storage with the free version. Its strength is with vector graphics, with an impressive range of tools. You’ll have to pop for the professional plan to get invite-only private projects. Otherwise, you can share a link for collaboration.
                    Figma gives businesses a lot of latitude with customization, particularly at the organization level. You can create and administer private plugins. Comparatively speaking, it is an affordable plan.</p>
